			<p>Yakuza, known in Japan as Ryū ga Gotoku (龍が如く, Like a Dragon), is an open world action-adventure beat 'em up video game franchise created, owned and published by Sega. The series originated from Toshihiro Nagoshi's desire to create a game that would tell the way of life of the yakuza. Nagoshi initially struggled to find a platform for the project, until Sony showed interest in the prospect.<br>

The series primarily focus on the yakuza Kazuma Kiryu from the Tojo clan. While Kazuma often assists the Tojo clan, the series has also featured him searching for another way of life in the form of raising orphans. The gameplay of Yakuza has the player controlling Kazuma (or another character depending on the title) in an open world where he can encounter an enemy or perform an activity in the city to obtain experience.
<br>
The franchise has become a commercial and critical success, and as of 2017, Sega has reported that the Yakuza franchise has sold a combined total of 10.5 million units in physical and digital sales since its debut in 2005.[2] Strong sales of the games in its original Japanese market has led to the franchise's expansion to other mediums, including film adaptations.</p>

			<h2>The Game</h2>
			
			<p>  In all games the player controls Kazuma Kiryu, who is the sole playable character in the first three entries. The game is made of three distinct yet connected modes called Event, Adventure and Battle. The main character randomly encounters foes on his path. The ensuing fight is called Encounter Battle. In fights the player character uses hand-to-hand combat while weapons can also be wielded, though firearms are rare. Winning somes of these battles can result in the player winning money which can be used to purchase equipments or healing items. Encounter Battles caused by the story can end quicker by finishing the leader of the enemies. Some of these tend to include quick time events. Across his fights, Kazuma gains experience. This can be used to expand his stats and become a stronger fighter.<br><br>

            The player can also travel across the cities and participate in different events such as the handling of host clubs, fighting tournaments among others. These encounters help Kazuma win experience.
			<br><br> 
			
            The storytelling of the series is inspired by yakuza films, one of the most popular cinematic genres in Japan. The stories of the first two games in the series were written by novelist Hase Seishu, a writer of crime fiction. It was brought to the screen by director Takashi Miike. The main story is presented in chapters, much like Kinji Fukasaku's classic yakuza movie Sympathy for the Underdog and is expanded upon with around a hundred subplots per game. The depth this provides leads to the series having a large cast of characters, including many which recur in minor roles.</p>

		<h2>Biography</h2>
		<p> While much of Majima's personal life is unknown, the furthest scene into the past that he ever appears in has him talking with Saejima about an upcoming hit on behalf the Tojo clan. The plan was to promote the Sasai family to a higher position by launching a hit on the Ueno Seiwa family Patriarch, whom was released from prison and planning to rebuild his clan. Bringing with him a bag containing 6 disposable revolvers, they planned a hit with Majima making protests about not telling Yasuko that both of them are likely to end up in prison for their assassination and Saejima brushing him off.<br>

<br>On the day of the hit however, Majima received a phone call from Shibata to forbid him from going to the assassination as the Dojima Family did not want to hold joint responsibility and letting Saejima going off to make the move that would shake the clan for years to come. When Majima refuses, Shibata summons a crowd of men to attack him. Despite his best efforts, he was narrowly bested and chained. Shibata takes out a knife and stabs Majima in the eye before leaving him at the mercy of Shimano.<br>

<br>Three years after the hit, Majima was held captive in Osaka, under surveillance from Tsukasa Sagawa. During his later days in Osaka, he befriended Naoki Katsuya, an action film actor at the time and married Mirei Park, who was an aspiring Idol at the time. However, his marriage with Park didn't end well as Majima divorced her after discovering that Park aborted her pregnancy.</p>

			<h2>Biography</h2>
			<p>Ryuji was born as the son of the Jingweon boss and his wife Suyeon Jon. Four years old at the time of the Jingweon massacre, he is one of its few survivors along with his mother.<br>

<br>Fleeing to Sotenbori, she met Jin Goda, whom she told her story. Running from the mafia and exhausted from keeping her son safe, Jin took them in. When she meets Jiro Kawara, Jin begs for her to leave Ruyji with him. She obliges and Ruyji is adopted by Jin.<br>

<br>In contrast to other fighting styles such as Kiryu's, Goda uses a realistic, "sloppy" street fighting style. He uses an array of haymakers, wild punches and back kicks to attack. His grapples consist on mostly knees to the gut. Later in the game, he will use a Katana to attack, causing a lot more damage. He swings it in a wild manner, without any real technique or skills, using one hand to do so. In the final battle against him, he will use his regular fighting style, with the addition of a few more punches.<br>

<br>In Dead Souls, because of an alternate reality where he didn't die, he no longer fights barehanded, but instead uses a gatling gun attached to his hand. He can still use kicks and tackles to keep the zombies at bay, and can even pick up weapons such as bats, pipes and more. His gatling gun is the fastest weapon in the game.</p>
